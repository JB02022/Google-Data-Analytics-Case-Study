In this case study, I will be working for a fictional company called Cyclistic. The goal is to maximize the number of annual members by understanding how casual riders and members use Cyclistic differently. Cyclistic has a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that
are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. I will be using the last 12 months of Cyclistic's historical trip data to analyze and identify trends.

The data is directly from the Cyclistic company, made available by Motivate International Inc. under this license. Due to data-privacy issues personally identifiable information won’t be used. Thus, I will not connect pass purchases to credit card numbers 
to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes. The data is reliable, original, comprehensive, current, and cited. During the analysis, I will be using Excel, SQL, and R. It’s important to 
clean data so that it’s complete, correct, and relevant to the problem. I will be cleaning the data by fixing incorrect entries, deleting duplicates, removing blanks, and making sure the format is consistent.
